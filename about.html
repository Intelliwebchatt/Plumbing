                <h2>Our Story </h2>
                <p>In 1981, Caldwell & Sons Plumbing was founded right here in Prattville, Alabama, with a simple mission: provide honest, reliable plumbing services at fair prices.  What began as a small family operation has grown into a trusted local name, serving homeowners and businesses throughout Prattville, Millbrook, and our surrounding communities for over four decades.  As a family-owned and operated business, we understand that your home's plumbing is essential to your daily comfort.  That's why we approach every job—from a simple faucet repair to a complete sewer line replacement—with the same level of care and attention to detail we would give our own homes. </p>
                
                <h2>Our Mission and Values </h2>
                <p>Our mission is to deliver quality workmanship and lasting solutions with integrity and transparency.  We believe in doing the job right the first time, using premium materials and standing behind our work.  As your neighbors, we are deeply connected to our community and take pride in ensuring the comfort and safety of the homes we service.  We are committed to continuous improvement, staying current with the latest plumbing technologies and safety standards to provide you with the most effective solutions available. </p>

                <h2>Why We're Different </h2>
                <p>In an industry where it can be hard to find a plumber you trust, we build relationships based on honesty and transparency.  Our reputation matters to us, so we focus on providing accurate diagnoses and fair, upfront pricing with no hidden fees.  We're not interested in upselling you on services you don't need; we're interested in providing the right fix that protects your home and your budget. When you call us, you're not just a customer—you're a neighbor. </p>
